=======================
Writing Module in lib
=======================

- Add class/module in lib which do not belong in controller/model
  and which is to be used at multiple places

- Import that module in file whenever required

- Add the lib file path in config/application.rb
  to load that file during project building
  - # config/application.rb
    ------------------
	module MyApp
	  class Application < Rails::Application
		config.eager_load_paths << "#{config.root}/lib"  # incase files are inside lib folder
		config.eager_load_paths += Dir.glob "#{config.root}/lib/*/"  # incase files are in floders inside lib
		OR
		config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib')  
	  end
	end
	
	- config.root and Rails.root are same

- Create module as
  # /lib/foo.rb
  -------------
  module Foo
    def hello
      "hello"
    end
  end

- include in model as 
  # app/models/customer.rb
  -----------------
  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    include Foo
  end
