Rails eager_load_paths vs autoload_paths
=========================================

autoload_paths
--------------
- In rails, we need not to add require for each controller/models/uploaders/etc..
  as rails load the files in them using autoload_paths
- Whenever, a class/module is not found in a file it checks for it in autoload_paths
- Get the list using config.autoload_paths

eager_load_paths
----------------

- In production, loading file when required (autoload) can be time consuming.
  eager load loads all the file during project startup, this result in slower startup time 
  but faster API response time
- eager_load_paths provide list of directory whose files are to be eager loaded

- Get the value using config.eager_load_paths
