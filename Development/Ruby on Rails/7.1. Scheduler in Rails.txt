==================
Scheduler in Rails
==================

- cron jobs
  - job scheduler that lets you execute recurring tasks at fixed times
  - Jobs are written in a file called the crontab (short for “cron table”)
  - Typically, saved in: /usr/bin/

- Gem: 
  - Whenever
    - helps you set up cron jobs
	- whenever update the crontab for you by writing your jobs in Ruby code\
	- use "schedule.rb" to make edits

- Note: the actual task itself (like, sending out batch messages periodically) 
  should not be written in the crontab, or in schedule.rb. 
  - The task itself should be written separately as a Rake task. 
  - You can then schedule that Rake task on a regular basis as a cron job.


Configure
=========
- Add to Gem File
  - gem 'whenever', require: false

- create config/schedule.rb file
  $ bundle exec wheneverize

- Config file: config/schedule.rb
  - Specify when to execute the job, 
  - and the name of the Rake task
  - Ex. if you want to execute the Rake task batch:send_messages every minute
    every 1.minute do
      rake 'batch:send_messages'
    end

- Write the whenever task to your crontab
  - bundle exec whenever --update-crontab
    - Default env is production
	- Use --set environment='development' for dev environment

Other Commands
==============
- Display crontab: 
  $ crontab -l
- Clear crontab of your whenever task: 
  $ bundle exec whenever --clear-crontab
