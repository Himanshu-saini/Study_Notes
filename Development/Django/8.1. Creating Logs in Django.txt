=============
LOGGING
=============
- Django uses Python’s builtin logging module to perform system logging.
- Python logging configuration consists of four parts:
  - Loggers
  - Handlers
  - Filters
  - Formatters
  
  
Loggers
=========
- A logger is the entry point into the logging system. 
- Each logger is a named bucket to which messages can be written for processing.
- A logger is configured to have a log level.
- A log record can also contain useful metadata that describes the event that is being logged. 
- This can include details such as a stack trace or an error code.
- Once a logger has determined that a message needs to be processed, it is passed to a Handler.

Log Level
--------------
- log level describes the severity of the messages that the logger will handle.
- Python defines the following log levels:
  - DEBUG: Low level system information for debugging purposes
  - INFO: General system information
  - WARNING: Information describing a minor problem that has occurred.
  - ERROR: Information describing a major problem that has occurred.
  - CRITICAL: Information describing a critical problem that has occurred.

Handlers
==========
- The handler is the engine that determines what happens to each message in a logger. 
- It describes a particular logging behavior, such as writing a message 
  to the screen, to a file, or to a network socket.
- handlers also have a log level. 
- If the log level of a log record doesn’t meet or exceed the level of the handler, the handler will ignore the message.

Filters
===============
- A filter is used to provide additional control over which log records are passed from logger to handler.
- By installing a filter, you can place additional criteria on the logging process. 
- For example: 
  you could install a filter that only allows ERROR messages from a particular source to be emitted.
- Filters can also be used to modify the logging record prior to being emitted. 
- Filters can be installed on loggers or on handlers; multiple filters can be used in a chain to perform multiple filtering actions.

Formatters
==============
- Formatters describe the exact format of that text. 
- A formatter usually consists of a Python formatting string containing LogRecord attributes
- however, you can also write custom formatters to implement specific formatting behavior.
