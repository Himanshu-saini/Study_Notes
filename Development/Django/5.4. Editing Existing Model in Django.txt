Editing Existing Models
========================

To change a field name in django 1.7+
========================================
- Edit the field name in the model (but remember the old field name: you need it for step 3!)
- Create an empty migration
  $ python manage.py makemigrations --empty myApp
- Edit the empty migration (it's in the migrations folder in your app folder, and will be the most recent migration) by adding
  migrations.RenameField('MyModel', 'old_field_name', 'new_field_name'),
  to the operations list.
- Apply the migration  
  $ python manage.py migrate myApp

Rollback migrations
===========

- show the names of all the migrations
  $ manage.py showmigrations my_app
  
- Find the migration you want to go to, then
  $ python manage.py migrate <app_name? <migration_name> 
  - Ex.
    $ manage.py migrate my_app 0010_previous_migration 
    OR 
    $ manage.py migrate my_app 0010 

- reverse all migrations for an app
  $ manage.py migrate my_app zero
