Editing Existing Models
========================

To change a field name in django 1.7+
========================================
- Edit the field name in the model (but remember the old field name: you need it for step 3!)
- Create an empty migration
  $ python manage.py makemigrations --empty myApp
- Edit the empty migration (it's in the migrations folder in your app folder, and will be the most recent migration) by adding
  migrations.RenameField('MyModel', 'old_field_name', 'new_field_name'),
  to the operations list.
- Apply the migration  
  $ python manage.py migrate myApp
