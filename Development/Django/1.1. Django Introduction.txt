============
DJANGO
============
- Django follows a Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture
  - Model is the logical data structure
  - View is the user interface
  - Controller is the middleman,  one passing data from the model to the view.

- Model-View-Template (MVT):
  ---------------------------
  - Django itself takes care of the Controller part
  - view is used to execute the business logic and interact with a model 
    to carry data and renders a template. 
    It is not necessarily how the data looks, but which data gets presented.
  - Template is a presentation layer that handles the User Interface part completely.

- The model will work with the data, the view will work with the logic, and the template will work with the layout.
- Django views to be the controllers and Django templates to be the views.
