@task(max_retries=3, retry_delay=timedelta(seconds=10))
def extract_reference_data():
    # same as before ...

- More Ways to Handle Failures
  - Task Triggers: selectively execute Tasks based on the states from upstream Task runs.
  - State Handlers: provide a Python function that is invoked whenever a Flow or Task changes state
  - Notifications: Get Slack notifications upon state changes of interest or use the EmailTask in combination with Task Triggers.
