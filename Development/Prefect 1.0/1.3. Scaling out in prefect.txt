Scaling Out
==============

- adjust our Flow to distribute its Tasks onto a Dask Cluster, parallelizing its execution

from prefect.executors import DaskExecutor
# ...flow definition...
if __name__=="__main__":
    flow.run(executor=DaskExecutor())

- This will spin up a Local Dask Cluster on your system to parallelize the tasks.
- specifying the address in the DaskExecutor constructor
  - executor=DaskExecutor(
        address='some-ip:port/to-your-dask-scheduler'
    )
