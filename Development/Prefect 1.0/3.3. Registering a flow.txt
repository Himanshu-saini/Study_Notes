================
Register a Flow 
================
- Flow must be registered so it is managed by the backend
- Add this command after creating a flow
  - flow.register(project_name="tutorial")

- When a flow is registered
  - flow is validated to catch common errors.
  - The flow's source is serialized and stored in the flow's Storage on your infrastructure( Docker image,S3 bucket, or GitHub repository).
  - The flow's metadata is packaged up and sent to the Prefect backend. 
    - code itself remains safe and secure on your infrastructure
