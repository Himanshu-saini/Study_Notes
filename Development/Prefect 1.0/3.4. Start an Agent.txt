===============
Start an Agent
===============

- https://docs-v1.prefect.io/orchestration/agents/overview.html

- lightweight processes for orchestrating flow runs.
- responsible for starting and monitoring flow runs.
- both Prefect Agents (and flow runs) only send requests out to the Prefect API, and never receive requests themselves
- A single agent can manage many concurrent flow runs
- have multiple active agents if you need to support flow runs on different deployment platforms.

Agent Types
-----------
- Local: The Local Agent executes flow runs as local processes.
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- GCP Vertex
- AWS ECS

- Start via the CLI
  -----------
  - $ prefect agent <AGENT TYPE> start
- Python API
  --------
  from prefect.agent.local import LocalAgent
  LocalAgent().start()


Authentication
-------------
- Prefect agents rely on the use of an API key from Prefect Cloud.
- pass an API key via CLI to an agent
  - $ prefect agent <agent-type> start --key "API_KEY"

Change Prefect API address
------------------
- Prefect agents query the API for any pending flow runs.
- Change defaiult prefect APi address from CLI using 
  - prefect agent <AGENT TYPE> start --api <API ADDRESS>

- Prefect API Address
  - https://api.prefect.io for Prefect Cloud
  - http://localhost:4200 for Prefect Server


Lables
------
- Agents have an optional labels argument which allows for separation of execution when using multiple agents
- By default, agents have no set labels and will only pick up runs from flows with no specified labels.

- provide Lable
  - prefect agent <AGENT TYPE> start --label dev --label staging
