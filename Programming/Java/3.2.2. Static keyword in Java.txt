======================
Static keyword in Java
======================

- Static is used for memory management mainly
- We can create static methods, variables and blocks
  - created using "static" keyword
- Constructor can not be static

- Static members of class belongs to class itself instead of class objects
  - static members can be called/used without creating an object
  - Ex: <Class name>.<statix var/method>;

- Static variable
  - when we declare any object as static
  - used to refer to common property of all objects
  - Static variable gets memory only once in the class area 
    at the time of class loading
    - therefore they are memory efficient

- static method
  - declare method using static keyword
  - can be invoked without using an instance of a class
  - static method can only call static data emmbers or static methods

- Ex
  public class Person{
    String name;
    static int age = 0;  // static variable
    
    public static printAge(){  // static method
      System.out.println("Age is "+age);
    }
    
    pubic static void main(String[] args){
      Person.name;  // Gives error
      Person.age;   // Correct
      
      Person obj1 = new Person();
    }
  }
