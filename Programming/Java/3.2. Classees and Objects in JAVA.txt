Classees and Objects in JAVA
=============================

Classes
=======
- Collection of objects / blueprint of the object
- Class variables are used to define state of the class
- Class functions/methods are used to define the behaviour of the class
- By default, class, class methods, class variables are private
- Syntax:
  <access specifier> class <class name>{
    // code
  }
  - <class name>
    - Same as the file name
    - contain alphanumeric characters
    - must start with apbhabets

Objects
========
- Entity that has state and behaviour
- It can be defines as an instance of a class
- Syntax for creating objects:
  <Class name> <object name> = new <class name>();
  - Ex: Person pObj = new Person();
- We can define multiple objects of the same class
- Class methods and variables are accessed using objects
  - Syntax:
    <Obj name>.<var/func()>;
  - Ex
    pObj.name;  // gives the value of name attribute
    pObj.printData();  // execute the function printData()
