====================
Inheritence in JAVA
====================

- When one class acquires all the properties and behavour of a parent class
- Provides code reusability

- It is done using "extends" keyword
- Syntax:
  public class A1 extends B1{ ... }
  - Here, class A1 is child class 
  - class B1 is parent class

- It represents a "IS-A relationship" in Java
  - like, class student "IS-A" person

- We can create the object of parent class in child class
  and access its variables and methods

Types of Inheritance
=====================

- Single inheritance
  -------------------
  - Only one class extends another class
    class A <- Class B
  - Ex.
    class student extends person{ ... }
  - Public/private variables and members of parent class can be 
    called directly in child class

- Multilevel inheritance
  ----------------------
  - One class extends an class which is already extended to another class
    class A <- class B <- class C
  - Ex.
    class car extends vehicle{ ... }
    class BMW extends cars{ ... }
  - Can go to any level
  - lower class can access all variables and methods 
    present in upper classes
    - can create objects of all upper classes
    - can use all methods/variables of upper classes directly
  - When object of click class is created 
    constuctor of all upper classes is called.

- Hierarchical inheritance
  -------------------------
  - More than one class extends to same parent class
    class A <- class B
    class A <- class C
  - Ex.
    class student extends person{ ... }
    class teacher extends person{ ... }

- Multiple Inheritance (not allowed in Java)
  ----------------------------------------
  - When one class extends more than one class
    Ex. class student extends programmer, artist{ ... }
  - Due to possibilities of coflict among methods and variables of Parent classes 
    - Ex. 
      if both classes have method/variabe with same name.
      when both class are inherited and that method/variable 
      is called inside child class
      the conflic arises as to whom the reference is made
