Loops in Java
==============

- Loops are used to run set of intructions repetedly until a condition is satisfied

- Iteration
  - One complete run of set of instruction inside a loop

Types of Loop
=============

- For loop
  ---------
  - Most used
  - Used when no of iteration is fixed
  - Syntax:
    for(initializaton; condition; incr/decr){
      // statements
    }
    - initialization
      - optonal
      - variable is given an initial value
    - Condition
      - check condition for determine if the loop will run or not
      - the loop will run until teh condition becomes false
    - incr/decr
      - optional
        - if control variable is changed inside the loop body
      - the control variable is incremented/decremented

- While loop
  -----------
  - When number of iteration is not fixed
  - Syntax:
    while(condition){
      // statements
    }
    - condition
      - the loop will run until teh condition becomes false
  
- Do-while
  ---------
  - Same as while but the condition is checked at the end
  - So the loop will execute atleast once
  - Syntax:
    do{
      // statements
    }while(condition);
