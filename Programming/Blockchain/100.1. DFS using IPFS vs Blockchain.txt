DFS using IPFS vs Blockchain
=============================

What is IPFS
=============
- Interplanetary File System
- originally created by Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs.
- Distributed file storage system
- Create file hash to locate the file location
- keeps track of files and their respective versions 
  from everyone in a network.

- Security
  --------
  - When uploading and accessing files on IPFS, 
    we can grant access to certain users by encrypting the file itself 
    with the public key of our recipient.

Storaging File directly on Blockchain 
======================================
- Storage on the blockchain is extremely expensive. 
- According to estimates* it costs $100 per GB of storage
  in which we can but 500GB HHD

Blockchain and IPFS 
===================
- IPFS stores a file in the network and creates its hash.
- IPFS simply stores the hashes to files on the blockchain.
- These hashes can then be used to find the actual location of the file.

- Use cases
  ----------
  - no “servers” hosting websites
  - You won’t have to “sign up” for accounts.
    Your private key will grant permission and access 
	to your identity to websites/providers.
  - Direct communication with another party without middle man
    Truly secure, private and censorship free communication applications.
  - Social Networks
