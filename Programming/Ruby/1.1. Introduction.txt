==================
Ruby Instroduction
==================

- file extension: ".rb"
- run
  > ruby file.rb

- 1st line in program file tells 
  Unix-like OS how to run the file
  - #!/usr/bin/env ruby

- Import library
  - use "require" keyword
  
- if __FILE__ == $0
  - check “If this is the main file being used…”
  
- read docs on the command line
  > ri 

- no special line terminators, except the usual newline

- Only One type of list : Arrays []
- Hashes {} : like python dict

- There’s no way to unset a variable once set (like Python’s del)
  - reset a variable to nil, allowing the old contents to be garbage collected, 
    but the variable will remain in the symbol table as long as it is in scope.

Comments in Ruby 
=================
- Single line Comment
  -------------------
  - every line followed by "#"
  - Ex. # This is a comment in ruby

- Multiline comment
  -----------------
  - using =begin and =end
  - The =begin and =end must be at the beginning of the line 
  - Ex.
    =begin
    this is a comment
    =end
