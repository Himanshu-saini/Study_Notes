Loops in Ruby
==============

- using "each" method
  - takes a block of code and run it for each item in a iterable list
  - Ex
    nameList.each do |name|
      puts "Hello #{name}"
    end

  - do ... end is a block of code
    - A block is like an anonymous function or "lambda"
    -  The variable between pipe characters is the parameter for this block.

  - Internally, the each method will essentially call yield <value>

- 3.times do
    print 'Welcome '
  end
