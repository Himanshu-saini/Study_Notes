==========================
MySQL connection in Python 
==========================

- Library
  - import MySQLdb

Connect to DB server
----------------------
-	self.db = MySQLdb.connect(host=<Server Endpoint>, user=<username>,
						passwd=<user password>, db=>DB name>
						use_unicode=True, charset='utf8mb4')
    - DB name is optional
	self.cursor = self.db.cursor()
	self.cursor.connection.open


Run Command
============

Single Command 
--------------
- execute()


Batch Execution
-----------------

- For Oracle DB:
  https://blogs.oracle.com/opal/post/efficient-and-scalable-batch-statement-execution-in-python-cx_oracle

- executemany()
  - Better incase of batch operation
  - cursor.executemany("""
        insert into ParentTable (ParentId, Description)
        values (:1, :2)""", data)
  - determining how many rows are affected
    - cursor.rowcount

- Handling Bad Data
  -----------------
  - Using executemany(), execution stops at 
    the first error that is encountered

- Variable Data lengths
  ---------------------
  - When data is not uniform in type and size in batch
  - type determination is deferred until a value that is not None is found
  - adjust the size of the buffers used to store strings and bytes 
    when a longer value is encountered in the data
  - It will incur overhead as program reallocate memory 
    and copy all of the data that has been processed thus far.
	
  - Solution: cursor.setinputsizes(<type>,<Size>) 
    - tell about the type and size of the data
	- Since program allocates memory for each row based on this value 
	  it is best not to oversize it.
	
Commit and Rollback
====================

- In both the execute() and executemany() cases, 
  rows that were inserted successfully open a transaction 
  which will need to be either committed or rolled back 
  with connection.commit() or connection.rollback(), 
  depending on the needs of your application.
  
- Note that if you use autocommit mode, 
  the transaction is committed only when no errors are returned; 
  otherwise, a transaction is left open and will need to be 
  explicitly committed or rolled back.
