Multiprocessing in Python
==========================

- Module 
  - import multiprocessing

- ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time
- Multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines, OS then allocates 
  these threads to different processors improving performance of the system.
- Each process runs independently and has its own memory space.
- As soon as the execution of target function is finished, the processes get terminated

- Multiprocessing system
  ----------------------
  - multiprocessor
    - a computer with more than one central processor.
  - multi-core processor
    - a single computing component with two or more 
      independent actual processing units (called “cores”).

Usage
-----
- Creating
  - multiprocessing.Process(target=print_square, args=(10, ))
- Start
  - p1.start()
- stop execution of current program until a process is complete
  - p1.join()

- Get ID
  - os.getpid()
- Check if process active
  - p1.is_alive()
