===================
Doubly Linked List
===================
- There are 2 links between nodes of Linked List 
  - One for previous node 
  - Second for next node 

- Previous link for 1st node and next link for last node is NULL


Node Structure
==============

struct node{
  int data;
  struct node* prev;
  struct node* next;
};

HEAD pointer 
-------------
struct node* HEAD = nullptr;  // Store address of first element of Linked list

Advantages
===========
- We can move in both directon in a list 

Disadvantages
==============
- Extra overhead to store prev address.
- Insertion/Deletion of nodes in more complex
