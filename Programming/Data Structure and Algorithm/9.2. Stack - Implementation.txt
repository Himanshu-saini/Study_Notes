Stack - Implementation
=======================

- using Array
  -----------
  - Maintain an array (say int stack[size]) and a top variable
  
- Using Linked List
  -----------------
  - HEAD pointer act as top variable in stack
  - Inserting element 
    - Add new element at the beginning of linked list
  - Deleting element 
    - Remove element from the beginning of linked list
  - Stack Overflow condition
    - if a new node is not null
      it means that new memory cannot ne allocated by the program

- Errors in stack
  -----------------
  - Stack overflow
    - if we try to enter a new element in stack when it is full
  - Stack Underflow
    - if we try to remove an element from stack when it is empty

Operations 
===========
- pop
  - remove element from stack and return it 
- push
  - add element in stack 
- top
  - gives topmost element of stack
- size
  - gives number of elements in stack 
- isEmptyStack()
  - Check if there is any element in stack 
- isFullStack()
  - check is number of elements in stack is equal to its max size
- peek()
  - gives topmost element of stack
