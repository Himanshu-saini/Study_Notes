- Data Sructure which follows LIFO/FILO principle
- LIFO : Last In First Out
  - item which is stored in last is removed first

- Insertion/deletion is done from only one side of stack

  - Data type whose behavious is predefined by set of values
    or set of operations
  - user is least interested in implementation of its features
  - Ex. int, float, stack, queue

Applications
-------------
- Balancing of Sysbols
  - check whether the number of brackets are balanced in 
    a math expression
- Matching tag in HTML, XML

- Infix to Postfix/Prefix
  - Infix 
    - Operator come between operands
	- Ex: (a+b)*(c+d)
  - Postfix 
    - Operator come before operands
	- Ex: *+ab+cd
  - Postfix 
    - Operator come after operands
	- Ex: ab+cd+*
