===========================
		Data Types
===========================
- defines the type of variable declared.
- defianes how much size from memry will be allocated to the varaible
- Ex. int, char 

- Abstract Data Type 
  ------------------
  - Data type whose behavious is predefined by set of values
    or set of operations
  - user is least interested in implementation of its features
  - Ex. int, float, stack, queue

Fundamental Data types
=======================
- Build-in / Primitive Data types

- Boolean type - bool
  - only have 2 value : True(1) or False(0)
  - Size of 1 byte
  - Range : -128 to 127
  
- Integer Type - int 
  - contain whole number
  - Size depend on OS (Size of int is equal to size of the OS)
  - 16 bit OS have int size 2 bytes
  - 32 bit OS have int size 4 bytes
  - 64 bit OS have int size 8 bytes
  - Size and range can be changed using Modifiers
  
- Floating Point - float, double
  - contain decimal point numbers
  - Number of digits after the decimal point is double in case of double type.
  - Size of double is double to that of float type.
  - Size of float is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes

- Character type - char, wchat_t
  - used to store characters.
  - char is of 1 byte
  - wchar_t is of 2 bytes
  - Character are converted to ASCII value to store in memory. 

- void type 
  - it is not used for variables.
  - used with  function or pointers

Qualifiers
------------
- short
  - Depending on the copiler, it occupies less space or equal to int
- long
  - Occupies more space than int
- unsigned: 
  - Contain only positive values
  - Float does not have unsigned type
- signed: 
  - have both negative nad positive values
  - By Default, data types are signed

Derived Data types 
===================
- Derieved from Fundamental Data Type

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Reference Types

User Defined Data types
=========================
- Defined by user

- Type def
  - Give another name to the already defined data type.
  - Ex. 
    typedef short unsigned int sunint;
    sunint x,y;  

- Enumeration (enum)
- Structures
- Classes
