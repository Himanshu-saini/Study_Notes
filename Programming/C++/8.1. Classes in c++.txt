Classes in C++
===============

- Class is a user defined data type.
- Class is a blueprint, it does not exist
  i.e., no memory is allocated to it.
- Class encapsulates variables (properties) and functions

- Class contains:
  - Data members
    - variables of class
	
  - Member function 
    - function of class
	
  - Access Modifiers:
    ------------------
    - how the members of the class are accessed 
	  outside the class
    - Types:
      ------
	  - Public
	    --------
	    - members can be accessed outside the class
	    - Use this for members or features which are needed to 
	      be accessed outside  the class 
	  
	  - Private
	    --------
	    - default
	    - members cannot be accessed outside the class 
	      or inherited/child class
	    - Used to restrict usage of member of class (Data Hiding)
	    - Recommended to declare data members (varaibles) as private.
	  
	  - Protected
	    ----------
		- members cannot be accessed outside the class
	    - members can be accessed by the inherited/child class

- Ex
  class Person{
    private:    // Access Modifiers
	  string name;
	  int age;
	
	public:
	  string get_name();
	  void print_details();
  };

- Ways of defineing the member function
  -------------------------------------
  - Inside class 
    - function defined inside the class 
	- treated as inline function  // Doubt
	- Removes overhead of calling the function 
	- usually used for small functions 
	- More readable
	- Ex.
	  class Person{
	    ...
		void print_details(){
		  cout<<name<<" "<<age;
		}
      };
	  
  - Outside class
    - function declaration must be done inside the class
	- Function name, return type and parameter list 
	  is declared inside the class.
	- Ex
	  class person{
	    ...
		void print_details();
	  };
	  void Person::print_details(){
	    cout<<name<<" "<<age;
	  }
