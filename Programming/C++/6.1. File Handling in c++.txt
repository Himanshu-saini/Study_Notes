=====================
File Handling in C++
=====================

- Header file : <fstream>
- File stream classes 
  - ifstream
    - Allow read operation on file 
	- Do not create file if not file not found
  - ofstream
    - Allow write operation on file 
	- Create new file if not file not found
  - fstream
    - Allow Read and write operation on file 

- General purpose IO stream classes
  - istream
    - Allow read operation
  - ostream
    - Allow write operation 
  - iostream
    - Allow Read and write operation
   
- filestream and IO stream objects behave similarly

Modes in fstream 
----------------
- Read Mode
  - ios::in
  - Default mode in ifstream open 
- Write Mode 
  - ios::out
  - Default mode in ofstream open 
  - Overwrite the content in file 
  - It do not delete the previous content 
  - If the overwrite content is less than the file content 
    then the remaning content will be present
- Append Mode 
  - ios::app
- Truncate Mode 
  - ios::trunc
  - It delete the previous content of the file
    and then write in it.

- we can change default mode in ofstream open()
  - writeFile.open(path,obj::app)
    - it will append the data at the end of the file

- obj.open(<path>) 
  - used to open a file
  - <path> 
    = "D:\\custom\\path\\testFile.txt"
    - Double backslash is used as escape sequence
	- \\ means single \ in string

Operation on File 
==================

Check if the file is open
--------------------------
- obj.is_open()
  - return True if a file is open from the object
  
- available in all classes - ifstream, ofstream, fstream 

Read from file 
---------------
#include<iostream>
#include<strings>
#include<fstream>

void readFromFile(string filePath){
  ifstream readFile;
  readFile.open(path);
  string str;
  if(readFile.is_open()){
    readFile>>str;
    int n;
    readFile>>n;
    cout<<str<<"\n"<<n;
  }
}

Write in file 
---------------
#include<iostream>
#include<strings>
#include<fstream>

void writeInFile(string filePath){
  ofstream writeFile;
  writeFile.open(path);  
  string str = "Hi, this is a sample text";
  writeFile<<str<<"\n";
}
