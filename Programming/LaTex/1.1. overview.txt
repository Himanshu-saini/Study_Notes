===================
What is LaTex
===================
- plain documents with a .tex extension
- tool used to create professional-looking documents.
- can be used to generate several types of "human-readable" versions of the document
- based on the WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) idea
  meaning you only have focus on the contents of your document and the computer will take care of the formatting. 
  
=================
Why LaTex
===================
- used all over the world for scientific documents, books, as well as many other forms of publishing.
- create beautifully typeset documents
- allows users to very quickly tackle the more complicated parts of typesetting, 
  such as inputting mathematics, 
  creating tables of contents, 
  referencing and creating bibliographies, 
  and having a consistent layout across all sections.
- huge number of open source packages available
- it separates the content of the document from the style.

  - teTeX for Linux and other UNIX-like systems; it is no longer actively maintained now
  - proTeXt is based on MiKTeX

  
Using dedicated LaTex editors
===============================

- Freeware: LEd, WinShell
- Proprietary/Shareware: Inlage, Scientific WorkPlace, WinEdt

- There are also general-purpose editors that add LATEX-friendly options by means of plugins
  - emacs, vim, Atom, VS Code and Sublime Text.

===============
Output formats
===============

- PDF document
