Lengths in LaTex
=================
- units of distance relative to some document elements

Units
=======
- pt  a point is approximately 1/72.27 inch(0.3515 mm)
- mm  a millimeter
- cm  a centimeter
- in  inch
- ex  roughly the height of an 'x' (lowercase) in the current font (it depends on the font used)
- em  roughly the width of an 'M' (uppercase) in the current font (it depends on the font used)
- mu  math unit equal to 1/18 em, where em is taken from the math symbols family

Common Length Parameters
===========================
- Lengths can be changed by the command:
  \setlength{\length_paameter}{value_in_specified_unit}

Length           Description
--------         ------------
\baselineskip    Vertical distance between lines in a paragraph
\columnsep       Distance between columns
\columnwidth     The width of a column
\evensidemargin  Margin of even pages, commonly used in two-sided documents such as books
\linewidth       Width of the line in the current environment.
\oddsidemargin   Margin of odd pages, commonly used in two-sided documents such as books
\paperwidth      Width of the page
\paperheight     Height of the page
\parindent       Paragraph indentation
\parskip	     Vertical space between paragraphs
\tabcolsep       Separation between columns in a table (tabular environment)
\textheight      Height of the text area in the page
\textwidth       Width of the text area in the page
\topmargin       Length of the top margin

Using lengths as units
=======================
- Default lengths can also be used as units 
  to set the dimensions of other LATEX elements
- Ex.
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{lion-logo}
  [...]
  - width is set to 0.25 the width of the entire text area
