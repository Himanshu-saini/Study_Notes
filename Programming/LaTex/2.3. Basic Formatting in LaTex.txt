Basic Formatting
===============

Abstracts
==========
- include a brief overview of the main subject of the paper in scintific documents
- there's the abstract environment for this.
- put the text in a special format at the top of your document.

Paragraphs and newlines
========================
- if you need to start a new paragraph you must hit the "Enter" key twice
- To start a new line without actually starting a new paragraph 
  insert a break line point done by
  - \\ (a double backslash as in the example)
  - the \newline command.
- multiple \\ or \newlines are not used to "simulate" paragraphs with larger spacing
- recommended method to do so is to keep using double blank lines 
  to create new paragraphs without any \\
  and then add \usepackage{parskip} to the preamble.
  
Chapters and Sections
=======================
- the simplest form of organization is the sectioning, available in all formats.

Chapter 
----------
- /chapter{...}
- Chapter gives large heading in document

Sections 
------------
- \section{} marks the beginning of a new section
  - inside the braces is set the title
- Section numbering is automatic and can be disabled 
  by including a * in the section command as \section*{}
- We can also have \subsection{}s, and indeed \subsubsection{}s. 

Basic levels of depth are listed below:
----------------------------------------
-1	\part{part}
0	\chapter{chapter}
1	\section{section}
2	\subsection{subsection}
3	\subsubsection{subsubsection}
4	\paragraph{paragraph}
5	\subparagraph{subparagraph} 

- \part and \chapter are only available in report and book document classes.

Text formatting commands
=========================
- Bold 
  - \textbf{...} command.
- Italics
  - \textit{...} command.
- Underline
  - \underline{...} command.
- Ex.
  Some of the \textbf{greatest}
  discoveries in \underline{science} 
  were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.

- Emphasize
  - \emph{...} command.
  - inside normal text the emphasized text is italicized
  - behaviour is reversed if used inside an italicized text
  - some packages, e.g. Beamer, change the behaviour of \emph command
