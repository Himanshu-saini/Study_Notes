============================
Running LaTeX in Notepad++
============================

- Install MiKTeX ( LaTeX engine for windows)
- Install Notepad++
- Create a ".bat" file
  - For convinience create file as "miktex_latex.bat" 
    in notepadd++ intalled location
  - Code:
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  :: Called from Notepad++ Run
  :: [path_to_bat_file] "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" "$(NAME_PART)"
  :: Change Drive and  to File Directory
  %~d1
  cd %1
 
  :: Run Cleanup
  call:cleanup
 
  :: Run pdflatex -&gt; bibtex -&gt; pdflatex -&gt; pdflatex
  pdflatex %2
  bibtex  %2
  :: If you are using multibib the following will run bibtex on all aux files
  :: FOR /R . %%G IN (*.aux) DO bibtex %%G
  pdflatex %2
  pdflatex %2
 
  :: Run Cleanup
  call:cleanup
 
  :: Open PDF (Script updated based on comments by 'menfeser'
  :: START "" "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Reader 9.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" %2.pdf
  START "" %2.pdf
 
  :: (Alternative) Open PDF with Sumatra PDF
  :: START "" "C:\Progra~2\SumatraPDF\SumatraPDF.exe" %2.pdf -reuse-instance 
 
  :: Cleanup Function
  :cleanup
  :: del *.log
  del *.dvi
  del *.aux
  del *.bbl
  del *.blg
  del *.brf
  del *.out
  goto:eof
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  - The code will run the command written in the CMD.
  - All lines beginning with double colon :: are comments
  - %<num> denotes the parameter passed while runing the file 
  - START commend is to open pdf file created
    - if a program is not specified than pdf is opened in default program 
	- SumatraPDF is used in second comment which will update pdf without closing and reopening
	- Make sure there are NO spaces in the path (Use Progra~2, not Program Files (X86))
	- The -reuse-instance allows us to edit and recompile without quitting the PDF
  - multiple 'pdflatex" is used for cases where references are used ini the document.
  - "del" command is used to delete the temprary files created during "pdflatex"
    - remember that there is no other important files with same extentions which will be deleted

- Go To Notepad++ -> Run and paste the following in the prompt:
  "<PATH_TO_BAT_FILE>" “$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)” “$(NAME_PART)”
  - <PATH_TO_BAT_FILE> will be replaced with the actual path of miktex_latex.bat file.
  - rest of the parameter passed will be used by the BAT file.
- Create a keyboard shortcut when asked
  - like "Ctrl + L"
- Now create a LaTeX file in Notepad++, Save and Run (using the short key defined)

NOTE
-----
- MiKTex should be added automatically to Windows “path” 
  when it is installed else add manualy "WHERE_MIKTEX_INSTALLED\miktex\bin"
