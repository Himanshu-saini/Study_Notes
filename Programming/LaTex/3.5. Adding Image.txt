=======================
Adding images in lATEX
=======================

- you will need to use a package -  graphicx
  - \usepackage{graphicx}
  
- Add path from which image is included 
  - \graphicspath{ {images/} }
  - path is relative to the current directory
  - added in Document Preamble
  
- Includeing image in document 
  - \includegraphics{imageName}
  - imageName is name of the file containing the image without the extension
  - file name of the image should not contain white spaces nor multiple dots  
  - file extension is allowed to be included, but it's a good idea to omit it
  
- caption for the figure
  - \caption{a nice plot}
  - can place it above or below the figure
  
- Adddign lable
  - \label{fig:mesh1}
  - refer the image within your document
  -  label will number the image  
  - add reference with this name 
  
- Add reference
  - \ref{fig:mesh1}
  - code will be substituted by the number corresponding to the referenced figure

- If you are using captions and references on your own computer
  you will have to compile the document twice for the references to work

- Ex. 
  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{a nice plot}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
  \end{figure}

- we should always put them inside a figure environment or similar 
  so that LATEX will position the image in a way that fits in with the rest of your text

====================
Positioning images
====================
- default alignment for images is set to left

Using package "adjustbox"
=========================
- \usepackage[export]{adjustbox}
- enables an additional option in the \includegraphics command
  to change the default alignment of the image.
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, right]{exampleImage}
- available values are: left, right, center, outer and inner
  the last two are intended for two-sided documents.

Using The figure environment
=============================
- intended to provide automatic positioning.
- This environment uses a positioning parameter passed inside brackets
- Ex.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, inner]{lion-logo}
  \caption{Caption}
  \label{fig:figure2}
  \end{figure}

- You can put more than one value in the parameter
- Ex. 
  \begin{figure}[ht]
  LATEX will try to position the figure here, 
  but if it's not possible then the figure will appear at the top of the page. 
- Recommended to use more than one positioning parameter to prevent unexpected results.

Available Parameters 
--------------------  
- h   Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text
- t   Position at the top of the page.
- b   Position at the bottom of the page.
- p   Put on a special page for floats only.
- !   Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions.
- H   Places the float at precisely the location in the LATEX code. 
      Requires the float package. 
	  This is somewhat equivalent to h!.

Multiple images in one figure
===============================
- import the package subcaption
  \usepackage{subcaption}
- use the environment \subfigure
  - used inside a figure environment, 
  - takes one parameter: the width of the figure.
  - captions and labels can be set to each subfigure.

- Ex 
  \begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}  % Sub Figure 1
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth, height=5cm]{lion-logo} 
  \caption{Caption1}
  \label{fig:subim1}
  \end{subfigure}

  \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}  % Sub Figure 2
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth, height=5cm]{mesh}
  \caption{Caption 2}
  \label{fig:subim2}
  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{Caption for this figure with two images}  % Caption for both figures
  \label{fig:image2}
  \end{figure}

Wrapping text around a figure
===============================
- package "wrapfig"
  - text can be floated around the images
- import the package
  - \usepackage{wrapfig}
- Use the environment wrapfig
  - takes two parameters that are passed inside braces
  - the alignement that can be l, r, c, i or o; 
    this letters stand for left, right, centre, inner and outer 
	(the last two intended for two-sided documents)
  - The second parameter is the width of the figure
- Ex. 
  \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.25\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{lion-logo} 
  \caption{Caption1}
  \label{fig:wrapfig}
  \end{wrapfigure}
