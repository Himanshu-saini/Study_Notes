========================
Using Colors in LATEX
========================
- There are several elements in LATEX whose colour can be changed
- Colours can be manually defined to a desired tone using several models

- simplest manner: 
  - importing the package "color" or "xcolor"
  - provide a common set of commands for colour manipulation
  - latter is more flexible and supports a larger number of colour models

- amount of available colour names depends on the driver
- white, black, yellow, green, blue, purple cyan and magenta 
  can be used with any driver

Some Commands 
===============

- \color{blue} 
  --------------
  - sets the blue colour for the current block of text
  
- \textcolor{red}{...}
  --------------------
  - Changes the colour of inline text
  - used anywhere in document env.
  - first parameter: the color to use 
  - second parameter: the text whose color is to be changed
  
- \colorbox{BurntOrange}{this text}
  ----------------------------------
  - can be used anywhere in document env.
  - Changes the background colour of the text passed as second parameter
  
- \pagecolor
  ----------
  - background colour of the entire page can be easily changed
  - This is a switch command, 
    - meaning it will take effect in the entire document 
	  unless another switch command is used to revert it
- Ex. 
  \pagecolor{black}
  \color{white}  % to make the text white on block bg

- \nopagecolor
  --------------
  - change the background back to normal. 

Creating your own colours
============================
- the manner in which the colour is defined depends on the preferred model
- 4 colour models typically supported by any driver
  - \definecolor{mypink1}{rgb}{0.858, 0.188, 0.478}
  - \definecolor{mypink2}{RGB}{219, 48, 122}
  - \definecolor{mypink3}{cmyk}{0, 0.7808, 0.4429, 0.1412}
  - \definecolor{mygray}{gray}{0.6}

- \definecolor 
  - takes three parameters: 
    - the name of the new colour, 
	- the model, and 
	- the colour definition

- colour models that only xcolor support are
  - cmy: cyan, magenta, yellow
  - hsb: hue, saturation, brightness
  - HTML: RRGGBB
  - Gray: Grey scale, a number between 1 and 15.
  - wave: Wave length. Between 363 and 814.

- Commands available in xcolor:
  - \colorlet{LightRubineRed}{RubineRed!70!}
    -  mixture of 70% RubineRed and 30% white
	- obtain different tones of a main colour
  - \colorlet{Mycolor1}{green!10!orange!90!}
    - 10% green and 90%orange
	-  use any number of colours to create new ones with this syntax.
  - \definecolor{Mycolor2}{HTML}{00F9DE}
    - colour Mycolor2 is created using the HTML model
