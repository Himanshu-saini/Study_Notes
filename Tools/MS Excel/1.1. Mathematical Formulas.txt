Mathematical Formulas
======================
- The formuls having cell addresses changes value 
  dynamically as the value in teh selected range/cells change.

SUM
====
- Syntax:
  - =SUM(<cells address> or <Numbers>)
- Ex. =sum(2+10+189)

- Method 1 (using Shortcut):
  ---------------------------
  - Go to the last cell( or cell after that) of the column/row
  - Press "Alt and ="
  - It will sum all the numbers present in continuous 
    cells of the column/row before the current cell

- Method 2:
  ---------
  - Go to any cell 
  - Type "=sum(" 
  - Select the cells yuo want to add
    - select cells individually 
	  - Typing cell numbers seperated by ","
	    like =sum(A4,A10,B5,C10)
	  - Select one cell then add "," then another cell and repeat.
	  - By pressing Ctrl
	- Select range of cell
	  - typing range of cells as <start cell>:<end cell>
	    like =sum(C4:C10)
	  - By clicking and dragging to select range from mouse
	- Can use teh combinating of both 

AVERAGE
========
- Syntax:
  - =AVERAGE(<cells address> or <Numbers>)
- Ex. =AVERAGE(2,10,189)

- Method 1:
  ---------
  - Go to any cell 
  - Type "=average(" 
  - Select the cells yuo want to add
    - select cells individually 
	  - Typing cell numbers seperated by ","
	    like =average(A4,A10,B5,C10)
	  - Select one cell then add "," then another cell and repeat.
	  - By pressing Ctrl
	- Select range of cell
	  - typing range of cells as <start cell>:<end cell>
	    like =average(C4:C10)
	  - By clicking and dragging to select range from mouse
	- Can use teh combinating of both

COUNT
=====
- Count the number of cells containing numbers(or date) 
  in a range.
  
- Syntax:
  - =COUNT(<cells address range>)
- Ex. =COUNT(C12:C189)

- Method 1:
  ---------
  - Go to any cell 
  - Type "=count(" 
  - Select the cells yuo want to add
    - select cells individually 
	  - Typing cell numbers seperated by ","
	    like =count(A4,A10,B5,C10)
	  - Select one cell then add "," then another cell and repeat.
	  - By pressing Ctrl
	- Select range of cell
	  - typing range of cells as <start cell>:<end cell>
	    like =count(C4:C10)
	  - By clicking and dragging to select range from mouse
	- Can use teh combinating of both

COUNTA
=======
- count number of non empty cells in the range 

- Syntax:
  - =COUNTA(<cells address range>)
- Ex. =COUNTA(C12:C189)

CONCATENATE
===========
- add 2 or more strings

- Syntax:
  - =CONCATENATE(<cells address>,...)
  OR
  - =CONCAT(<cells address>,...)
- Ex. =CONCAT(C12,C18," ",C11)

- Method 1:
  ---------
  - Go to any cell 
  - Type "=concat(" 
  - Select the cells yuo want to add
    - select cells individually 
	  - Typing cell numbers seperated by ","
	    like =concat(A4," ",A10)
	  - Select one cell then add "," then another cell and repeat.
	  - By pressing Ctrl

IF formula
==========
- checks if logically condition is true or not

- Syntax:
  - =IF(<condition>,<True value>,<False value>)
  - True value
    - value shown when the condition is true 
    - Mandatory
  - False value:
    - value shown when the condition is true 
    - Defalut= "FALSE"
- Ex. 
  =IF(D4="Himanshu","Admin","User")
  =IF(A1<=200,"Average")

COUNTIF
========
- count the number of cells which meet the given criteria
  in the given range

- Syntax:
  - =COUNTIF(<range>,<criteria>)
  - criterai:
    - condition for the counting cell 
	- perform equality operation for string and numbers 
	- perform <,>,>=,...
	
- Ex. 
  =COUNTIF(C4:C10,"Himanshu")  
  // count number of cells containing string "himanshu"
  =COUNTIF(C4:C10,10)
  // count number of cells having value = 10
  =COUNTIF(C4:C10,"<10")
  // count number of cells having value < 10

SUMIF formula 
==============
- Sum based on the  given criteria 
- Checks the value in criteria in teh  given range 
  if teh  value is matched then the value 
  in the corresponding sum range cell is added to the result

- Syntax:
  - =SUMIF(<range>,<criteria>,<sun range>)
  - range which contains the criteria
  - criterai:
    - condition for the counting cell 
	- perform equality operation for string and numbers 
	- perform <,>,>=,...
  - sum range :
    - range which is to be added corresponding to the matching critera

- Ex 
  =sumif(C2:C22,B1,D2:D22)

VLOOKUP
========
- V is for vertical
- finds a value corresponding to the loopup value 
  from the list of values in table organized vertically.
  - take the look up value and search it in the list of value
  - For each value found, it takes teh corresponding value 
    from another column
- VLOOKUP supports approximate and exact matching, 
  and wildcards (* ?) for partial matches
- Lookup values must appear in the first column 
  of the table passed into VLOOKUP table_array. 
  
- Syntax:
  - =VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index, [range_lookup])
  - lookup_value 
    - The value to look for in the first column of a table.
  - table_array
    - The table from which to retrieve a value.
  - col_index 
    - The column in the table from which to retrieve a value.
	- The index should start from the first column 
	  of the selected portion of the table
  - range_lookup 
    - optional 
	- TRUE = approximate match (default). 
	- FALSE = exact match.
