INSERT in MySQL
================


INSERT IGNORE Statement
------------------------
- row with invalid data that cause the error are ignored

- In Batch Statement,
  the rows with invalid data that cause the error are ignored 
  and the rows with valid data are inserted into the table.

- INSERT IGNORE INTO table(column_list)
  VALUES( value_list),
    ( value_list),
    ...

- In INSERT IGNORE statement, instead of issuing an error, 
  MySQL issued a warning in case an error occurs.
- In addition, it will try to adjust the values 
  to make them valid before adding the value to the table.

- View warning using
  - SHOW WARNINGS

- Case 1:
  - While inserting duplicate data for a unique field
  - The row is ignored, and precess moves to next row

- Case 2:
  - If a longer string is added to field with set length
  - String is truncated to fit into the column

  
INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
----------------------------------

- INSERT INTO users_partners (uid,pid) VALUES (1,1) 
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE uid=uid


- Side-effects:
  - new auto-increment ID is generated, but it is not used in the changed row.
  - Same as REPLACE
  
- NOTE: REPLACE and INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE are non-standard, 
  proprietary inventions specific to MySQL
- NOTE: ANSI SQL 2003 defines a MERGE statement that can solve the 
  same need (and more), but MySQL does not support the MERGE statement.

REPLACE
--------
- REPLACE works exactly like INSERT, 
  except for a duplicate value for UNIQUE column 
  it performs a replace

- Side-effects:
  - A new auto-increment ID is allocated to the PRIMARY KEY ID.
  - Dependent rows with foreign keys may be deleted 
    (if you use cascading foreign keys) or else prevent the REPLACE.
  - Triggers that fire on DELETE are executed unnecessarily.
  - Side effects are propagated to replicas too.
