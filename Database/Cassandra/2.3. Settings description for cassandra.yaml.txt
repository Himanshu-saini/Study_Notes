Change the following settings for allow cassandra nodes to talk to each other:
===============================================================================
- open cassandra.yaml file (/etc/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml).

- cluster_name:	
  --------------
  Choose your cluster name here.
- seed_provider:
  --------------	
  This contains a comma-delimited list of each public IP address of each node to be clustered. 
  Input the list in the line that reads - seeds: "127.0.0.1".
- listen_address:
  ---------------
  listen address for cluster node communication i.e.,
  Other nodes in the cluster will use the IP address listed here to find each other. 
  Change from localhost to the specific node’s public IP address in case of multinode cluster.
- rpc_address:	
  --------------
  The listen address for client(like nodetool,cqlsh,..) communication.
  Change from “localhost” to the public IP address if you want to allow cassandra client tools from other nodes to access this node.
- endpoint_snitch:	
  ---------------
  Snitches determine how Cassandra replicates data. 
  Change this to “GossipingPropertyFileSnitch,” as this is more suitable to a multi-data center configuration.
- auto_bootstrap:
  ---------------	
  Add this property anywhere in the file. 
  If your node(s) already contains data, do not add this property.
  true (default) - this means that bootstrap/stream the data to the respective node from all the other nodes while starting/restarting
  false - If you have yet to add data to your nodes i.e., you would start with a fresh cluster.
	  this means do not stream the data while starting/restarting
          The new node will be added quickly irrespective of the current load of the cluster. 
	  Later we need to manually stream the data to the new node to make cluster load balanced.

- num_tokens:	
  -----------
  This property defines the proportion of data stored on each node. 
  For nodes with equal hardware capabilities, this number should be set equally between them so the data is more likely to be evenly distributed. 
  The default value of 256 is likely to ensure equal data distribution.

Sample cassandra.yaml settings:
==========================================
cluster_name: '[Your Cluster Name]'     // change it during setting up the cluster first time 
listen_address: [public_ip_address]     //This is IP address that other nodes in the cluster will use to connect to this one. It defaults to localhost and needs changed to the IP address of the node.
listen_interface: eth0			// when listen_address is commented and set nbroadcast_address
broadcast_address: [public_ip_address]	//same use as listen_address. listen_address should be commented 
rpc_address: [public_ip_address] 	//This is the IP address for remote procedure calls (cqlsh,nodetool).
num_tokens: 256
seed_provider:
- class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
	parameters:
	- seeds: "[node1_ip_address],[node2_ip_address]"    // set seed node address to the ip of servers which you want to make changes through

endpoint_snitch: GossipingPropertyFileSnitch	
auto_bootstrap: false	// add only when cluster/node does not have any data
