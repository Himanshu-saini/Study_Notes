Internal authentication
==========================
- validating user connection.
- The user is authenticated with login and password. 
- All the user accounts are managed in Cassandra internally.
- Authentication can also be controlled externally with 
  1. Kerberos (Kerberos is used to manage credentials securely) 
  2. LDAP (LDAP is used for holding authoritative information about the accounts, such as what they're allowed to access).
- Apache Cassandra does not support external authentication.
  Only datastax enterprise supports external authentication with Kerberos and LDAP.

Internal authorization 
========================
- It deals with what actions user can be performed.
- such as which user has only data read permission, 
  which user has data write permission 
  and which user has data delete permission.

Configure Authentication and Authorization
===========================================
- In Cassandra, by default authentication and authorization options are disabled.
- configure Cassandra.yaml file for enabling authentication and authorization.
- Edit lines that deals with internal authentication and authorization.
  # Authentication backend, implementing IAuthenticator; used to identify users
  # Out of the box, Cassandra provides org.apache.cassandra.auth.{AllowAllAuthenticator,PasswordAuthenticator}.
  authenticator: AllowAllAuthenticator
  # Authorization backend, implementing IAuthorizer; used to limit access/provide permissions
  # Out of the box, Cassandra provides org.apache.cassandra.auth.{AllowAllAuthorizer,CassandraAuthorizer}.
  authorizer: AllowAllAuthorizer
  # Part of the Authentication & Authorization backend, implementing IRoleManager; used
  # to maintain grants and memberships between roles.
  role_manager: CassandraRoleManager
  
Logging in
===========
- By default, Cassandra provides the super account with user name 'cassandra' and password 'cassandra'. 
- By logging in to 'Cassandra' account, you can do whatever you want.
- It is recommended to change the password from the default.
- for libin use:
  $ ./cqlsh -3 localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra
  
Alter Password
----------------
- cqlsh> alter user cassandra with password 'newpassword';

Create New User
----------------
-  Only Super user can create new users.
- cqlsh> create user robin with password 'manager' superuser;
  cqlsh> create user robin with password 'newhire';

List User:
----------
- cqlsh> list users;\

Drop User:
----------
- cqlsh> drop user himanshu;

Authorization
=============
- assigning permission to users that what action a particular user can perform.
- generic syntax:
  cqlsh> GRANT permission ON resource TO user
- examples :
  cqlsh> grant all on dev.emp to laura;
  cqlsh> revoke all on dev.emp to laura;
  cqlsh> grant select on dev.emp to laura;

Types of Permission:
---------------------
  ALL	 			ALTER
  AUTHORIZIZE 		CREATE 
  DROP	 			MODIFY 
  SELECT

List All Permissions:
-----------------------
- cqlsh> list all permissions of laura;
- cqlsh> list all permissions on dev.emp;
