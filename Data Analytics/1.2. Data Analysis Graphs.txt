Data Analysis Graph
=====================

- Frequency distribution / Histograms
  ------------------------------------
  - Graph platting value od distribution on x-axis with a bar showing 
    freqeuncy of data on y-axis.
  - Normal Distribution
    --------------------
	- Bell shaped graph
	- Symmetrical around center
	- The edges of graph is known as tail.
  - Properties
    -----------
	- Skew
	  -----
	  - Symmetry of distribution
	  - Positive skew
	    - lower values on x-axis have higher frequency
		- tail of graph pointing at higher values 
	  - Negative skew
	    - higher values on x-axis have higher frequency
		- tail of graph pointing at lower values 
	- Kurtosis
	  ---------
	  - "heaviness" of tail 
	  - Leptokurtic 
        - heavy tails.
		- Smooth slope
      - Platykurtic 
	    - light tails.
		- Steep Slope
