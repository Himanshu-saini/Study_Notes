The hierarchy of elements in Cassandra is:
- Cluster
  - Data center(s)
    - Rack(s)
      - Server(s)
        - Node (more accurately, a vnode)

A Cluster is a collection of Data Centers.
A Data Center is a collection of Racks.
A Rack is a collection of Servers.
A Server contains 256 virtual nodes (or vnodes) by default.
A vnode is the data storage layer within a server.
Note: A server is the Cassandra software. A server is installed on a machine, where a machine is either a physical server, an EC2 instance, or similar.

Now to specifically address your questions.
An individual unit of data is called a partition. And yes, partitions are replicated across multiple nodes. Each copy of the partition is called a replica.
In a multi-data center cluster, the replication is per data center. For example, if you have a data center in San Francisco named dc-sf and another in New York named dc-ny then you can control the number of replicas per data center.
As an example, you could set dc-sf to have 3 replicas and dc-ny to have 2 replicas.
Those numbers are called the replication factor. You would specifically say dc-sf has a replication factor of 3, and dc-ny has a replication factor of 2. In simple terms, dc-sf would have 3 copies of the data spread across three vnodes, while dc-sf would have 2 copies of the data spread across two vnodes.
While each server has 256 vnodes by default, Cassandra is smart enough to pick vnodes that exist on different physical servers.
