Cassandra:
=============
- Handle large data across many comodity systems
- NuSQL , Non Relational
- mix of Key-value store + column-oriented


Architecture:
===================
- Peer to peer 
- All nodes hacve same data
- read / write from anywhere
- no single point of failure
- Gossip protocol : each node to communicate with each other
- commit log - all activity
- suited for cloud deployement

Features:
=============
- Decentralized
- Replication : multiple datacenter deployment
- scalibility : new machines can be easily aded
- Fault tolerant
- Cassandra querry language (CQL)
- All changes sync automatically
- Always On architecture :  no downtime
- Operational simplicity : administration is simplified


Cassandra querry language (CQL):
=====================================
- Like SQL only in syntax 


Data storage:
============
- Keyspace -> like schema
- Column Family -> like tables but more flexible. 
Do not have to have predefined schema. 
Differnt records can have different fields
- Encourages "Denormalization" -> whereas relational DB uses "normalization"
Denormalization: No complex joins of data.


Types of NoSQL DB:
======================
- Key-value store
- Document DB
- Column DB 
- Graph DB 

Advantages of NoSQL:
============
- handle BigData
- Easier scaling
- cheaper hardware requirement

Data Model
============
- Models after Google "Big Table" and Amazon "Dynamo"
Cluster -> Data center(s) -> Rack(s) -> Server(s) -> Node (more accurately, a vnode)

Keyspace:
------------
- Keyspace : Container of data like schema 
Keyspace is used to group column families together
- Typically a cluster have one keyspace per application
- Replication is controlled per-keyspace basis. 
i.e. replication is defined for each keyspace seperately

Column family
--------------
- Similay to table
Keyspace -> Column Family -> Keys-value pair
In Keys value pair: Each key to linked to a columns of data
key -> (Column1,column2,column3...)
- Static Column: Each key is connected to similar type of column
- Dynamic Columns : Each key is connected to arbitary number and types of column

Replication Strategy:
------------------------
- Simple strategy: Single Data center. Not consider Network topology.
- NetworkTopologyStrategy: Cluster Span across multiple datacenters.
Specifies number of replica in each datacenter.
