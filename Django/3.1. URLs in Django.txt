Defining URLs
===============

- polls/urls.py
  --------------
  from django.urls import path
  from . import views

  urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
  ]

Use of path()
-------------
- Patterns in path() don’t search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name.
- When Django finds a matching pattern, 
  it calls the specified view function with an HttpRequest object as the first argument
- The path() function is passed four arguments, 
  - Two required: route and view
    - route : match the url
	- view : function to call when the url is matched
  - Two optional: kwargs, and name
    - kwargs
      Arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view
    - name
      Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates.

Regular expression pattern matching
-------------------------------------
- Re_path():
  Re_path(r”^/index$”,view.index)

Using include()
----------------
- Whenever Django encounters include(), 
  it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point 
  and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
- mysite/urls.py
  --------------
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import include, path

  urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  ]


===================
Features of URLconf
===================
- There’s no need to add a leading slash, because every URL has that. 
  For example, it’s "articles", not "/articles"
