===========
Gunicorn
==========
- Gunicorn is a lightweight WSGI server that can scale from small deploys to high-traffic sites. 
- Install: 
  $ pip install gunicorn. 
- Since Nginx will be listening for HTTP(S) requests, 
  you’ll need to bind Gunicorn to a different port. 
- While you’re at it, you can tell it to only respond to the localhost. 

- A simple gunicorn process might look like this:
  $ gunicorn --workers=4 --bind=127.0.0.1:9000 my_project.wsgi:application
  - This spawns a gunicorn process with 4 workers listening on http://127.0.0.1:9000. 
- If your project doesn’t already have a wsgi.py file, you’ll want to add one. 

Process Management
==================
- You want to be sure that gunicorn is always running 
  and that it starts up automatically after a server reboot. 
- If you are deploying to Ubuntu, upstart is probably the easiest way to get started. 

- Here is a sample config:
# logs to /var/log/upstart/my_project.log

description "my_project"
start on startup
stop on shutdown

respawn

# start from virtualenv path
exec /opt/webapps/my_project/bin/gunicorn  -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:9000 my_project.wsgi:application
setuid www-data

- Save this file to /etc/init/gunicorn.conf and run sudo start gunicorn. 
- For troubleshooting, your logs will be visible at /var/log/upstart/gunicorn.log.
