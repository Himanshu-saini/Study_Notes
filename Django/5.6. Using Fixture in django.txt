Fixture
=========
- A fixture is a collection of files that contain the serialized contents of the database. 
- Each fixture has a unique name.

- Django will search in three locations for fixtures:
  - In the fixtures directory of every installed application
  - In any directory named in the FIXTURE_DIRS setting
  - In the literal path named by the fixture
- Example:
  $ django-admin loaddata foo/bar/mydata.json   
  - would search <app_label>/fixtures/foo/bar/mydata.json for each installed application, 
  - <dirname>/foo/bar/mydata.json for each directory in FIXTURE_DIRS, 
  - the literal path foo/bar/mydata.json.

- load only JSON fixtures called mydata.
  $ django-admin loaddata mydata.json 
- look for any fixture of any fixture type called mydata.
  $ django-admin loaddata mydata 

- fixtures may be compressed in zip, gz, or bz2 format. 
  look for any of mydata.json, mydata.json.zip, mydata.json.gz, or mydata.json.bz2. 
  - The first file contained within a zip-compressed archive is used.
- if two fixtures with the same name but different fixture type are discovered , 
  fixture installation will be aborted, and data deleted

- Database-specific fixtures:
  For ‘master’ database defined, name the fixture mydata.master.json
