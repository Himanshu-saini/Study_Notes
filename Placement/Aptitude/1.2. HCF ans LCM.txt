HCF and LCM
============

HCF - Heighest Common Divisor
===============================
- Also GCD - Greatest Common Divisor 
- "x" is the GCD of n1 and n2 such that x is the 
  heightest number which divide both n1 and n2 

- If HCF of n1 and n2 is 1, then n1 and n2 are 
  Co-prime number or relatively prime to each other.

LCM - least common Multiple
============================
- "x" is LCM of n1 and n2 when x is lowest number
  that is exacly divisible by n1 and n2.
