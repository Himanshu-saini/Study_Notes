Time Speed and Distance
========================
- Distance = Speed * Time 

- Conversion of speed
  - km/hr to m/s 
    - multiply by 5/18
  - m/s to km/hr
    - multiply by 18/5

- Relative Speed 
  - Opposite direction
    - New speed = S1 + S2
  - Same direction 
    - New speed = S1 - S2
  
- Problems on Trains
  ------------------
  - Time taken by train to cross an object
    Speed of train = S1, Speed of Object = S2 
	Length of train = L1, Length of onject = L2
	Time = T
    - Stationary object, S2 = 0
	  - No Object length, L2 = 0
	    - S1 * T = L1 
	  - Object length = L2 
	    - S1 * T = ( L1 + L2 )
	    - Train has to cross Object length and its length 
	- Moving Object, S2 
	  - No Object length, L2 = 0
	    - Same direction 
		  - (S1 - S2) * T = L1
	    - Opposite direction 
		  - (S1 + S2) * T = L1
	  - Object length = L2 
	    - Same direction 
		  - (S1 - S2) * T = (L1 + L2)
	    - Opposite direction 
		  - (S1 + S2) * T = (L1 + L2)

- Problems on Boat and River
  --------------------------
  Speed og Boat = S1, Speed of Stream/River = S2 
  - Boat moving upstream
    - New Speed = S1 - S2 
  - Boat Moving Downstream
    - Net Speed = S1 + S2 

- Circular motion
  ----------------
  - Objects are moving in Circular Track
  - The objects starts from one point
    when the objects meet again is called "overlapping"
  - Case 1 : When A,B,C starts moving in circle from point P 
    in same direction, When will they meet again.
	S1,S2,S3 are speed of A,B,C where S1>S2>S3.
	T1,T2,T3 are time taken by A,B,C to complete the circle
	- Time after which They meet again at P = LCM(T1, T2, T3)
	
	- Time after which they meet again at any point = LCM(T12, T13)
	  - T12 = Time taken by A to overlap B 
	  - T13 = Time taken by A to overlap C 

- Clocks
  -------
  - Number of right angles in an hour = 2
    - Right angles are formed when time between 
	  hour and minute hand is 15 minutes ( +15 and -15)
  - Number of Strainght lines in an hour = 2
    - Strainght lines are formed when time between 
	  hour and minute hand is 30 min or 0 min
