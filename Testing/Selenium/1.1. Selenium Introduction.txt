  - Used to automate the web application
- Cannot be used for Desktop Application

- It is a Package to Tools

Components of Selenium
=======================

- Selenium IDE
- Selenium RC (Remote Control)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Selenium Grid

Selenium IDE
------------
- Selenium Integrated Development Environment
- Record and Play based tool
  - It will record the steps executed 
    and then play it afterward when required
- Browser plugin compatible with Mozilla Firefox only

- Limitation
  - Just a browser plugin
    - Cannot install it and use it in programming language
  - Only compatible with Mozilla firefox
  - Not allowed to put conditions in IDE (like if else)
  

Selenium RC
-----------
- First automated web testing tool that allowed user 
  to use their prefered language

- Compatible languages 
  - Java, C#, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python
- Compatible Broswers
  - Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE
  
- Pros
  - Cross browser and platform compatible
  - Can perform loops and conditional statements
  - Data Driven testing is possible 
  - Faster than IDE
  
- Cons
  - RC server needs to be run before executing the scripts
  - Not as fast as webdriver

Selenium WebDriver
------------------

- Compatible languages 
  - Java, C#, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python
- Compatible Broswers
  - Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE
  
- Pros
  - More stable than RC
  - Directly interacts with the browser
    - Does not rely on JavaScript for Automation
  
Selenium Grid
-------------
- Not used to prepare the automation script
- Used to execute the Script
  - Compatible tih RC or WebDriver Scripts
- It allows to execute the scripts in parallel
- It works as the execution engine for the selenium tests
- Enables simultaneous execution of tests in multiple browsers 
  and environment(Mac/Windows/linux)
  - Same test script will be used for all browsers/enviromments

- Uses Hub-and-node concept
  - Hub act as central source of selenium commands
  - nodes are the test machines which will perform the testing
