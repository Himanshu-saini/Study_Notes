Testing Process
================

- Steps during testing softwaare

- Basic Parts
  - Plan
  - Design
  - Execution

Test process by ISTQB (2018)
============================

- Consits of 7 Activities

- Test planning
  --------------
  - Write test plan
  
- Test Monitoring & control
  --------------------------
  - Monitor our actual progress with the expected progress in plan
  - In case of diffeernce, we perform control activities
  - Control is any action we take to follow our plan

- Test Analysis
  --------------
  - Analyse requirements and search for defects
  - find test conditions / test senerios
    - Ex., verify login via facebook/email

- Test Design
  ------------
  - Write our test cases
  - Each test senerio have one or more test cases

- Test Implementation
  -------------------
  - Organize test cases into test suites
  - Design our test environment where testing begin
    - Ex. Simulator, emulator, browser, Andriod

- Test Execution
  --------------
  - Execute tests and find defects and report them
  - Perform retesting and regression testing

- Test Completion
  ----------------
  - Test progress report
  - Test summary report
