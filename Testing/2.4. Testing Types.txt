Testing Types
==============

Functional Testing
------------------
- Most dominant type
- Test functions of a software
  i.e., what the system does
- Answered with Yes/No

Non-functional testing
----------------------
- Objective way of testing

- Check system performance
  - Like reponse time, performance speed
  - Depend upon the type of system
  - Usually provided output in a range
  
- Uability testing
  - System easy to use
  - User interface appealing enough

- Security testing
  - Provide output against set a of vunrabilities
  - Cannot say software is 100% secure or not
  
Block box Testing
-----------------
- A testing technique
- Test without looking on the 
  internal structure of the software
- Only provide input and test output

White box testing
-----------------
- Check the internal structure of the software
- Provide input and test what is happening 
  in the internal structure like APIs, Database
  
- More Advanced and Challenging
- Require understanding of the software stack used

Dynamic Testing
---------------
- Testing while executing the software
- Ex. Run code/App/Website/hardware

Static testing
--------------
- Testing while not executing the software
- Ex.
  - Reviewing requirements
  - Reviewing the User Stories
  - Review Protype UI
  - Review Code

Retesting (Confirmation testing)
--------------------------------
- When developer remove a defect
- Produce the same steps when the defects previously occur
  and check if the defect is there or not

Regression testing
-------------------
- When developer made any changes to the software
  - solving defect
  - changing requirement
  - adding/removing a feature

- In retesting we only test the part of software that is changed
  whereas in regression testing other part of software is also tested

Smoke testing / Build verification testing
-------------------------------------------
- In case of large software having many functionalities
- We have some test seniorios / test cases
  which test the main / most basic functionalities

- We perform it before other testing
- If it passes we procide to futher testing
  Else the software is send back for debugging
