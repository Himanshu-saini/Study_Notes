=====================================
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
=====================================

- Activities performed in order to develop a software

Phases of SLDC
--------------
- Planning 
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing and Integration
- Maintainence

Two Types
===========

Sequential
----------
- Phace of development follow linear, sequential follow
  One phase start only after the previous phase is ended
- In practice, phases may overlap
- Steps
    - Requirement
    - Design
    - Build 
    - Test & fix
    - Release
- Examples
  ---------
  - Waterfall Model
    ---------------
    - Activities flows only downward (like waterfall)
    - Activities
      - Requirements
      - Design 
      - Implementation
      - Testing
      - Maintainence
  
  - V-Model
    -------
    - More imphasis on Testing
    - Activities
      - User Requirement  -----------------> Acceptance Testing
      -  Software Specification  -------> System Testing
      -   High level Design  ---------> Integration Testing
      -    Low Level Design  -------> Unit Testing
      -      Coding
  
Iterative and incremental
--------------------------
- Iterative Model
  - We divide the software in parts and 
    completely build one part in each iteraton 
- Imcreamental Model
  - We build software as a whole but divide it into layers of development

- Examples
  --------
  - Scrum (Agile)
    -------------
    - Both iterative and increamental
    - We divide our software into iterations (Sprints) and 
      make some increaments (features) in each iteration
