DInsk 100% usage error in windows 10
=====================================

Symptoms
=========
- Task Manager shows the disk to be at 100% utilization despite a light or no workload, 
  and the system may experience lag or become unresponsive. 


Solution 1 - From Microsoft Center
==================================
- Task Manager might show 100% disk utilization on Windows 10 devices 
  with Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode enabled

- Symptoms
  --------
  - In addition to above, the system event log contains numerous events with Event ID 129,
    which represent resets of the disk controller.

MSI mode can be disabled for specific devices via the registry:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Identify if you are running the inbox AHCI driver (StorAHCI.sys):
  - Open a command prompt with administrator privileges. 
    Then type the following command in the command prompt window and hit Enter: 
	> devmgmt.msc
  - Under IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers right-click on the AHCI controller node and select Properties. 
    This node is usually called “Standard SATA AHCI Controller.”
  - Navigate to the driver tab and click Driver Details.
  - If you see “StorAHCI.sys” in the list, you are running the inbox driver.

- Disable MSI for the controller in the registry:
  - In the same properties window opened in step 1.2, navigate to the Details tab 
    and select Device instance path from the Property drop-down menu. Note this path.
  - Open the registry editor by typing regedit in the previously opened command prompt.
  - Navigate to: 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\ <AHCI Controller>
	\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties, 
	where <AHCI Controller> refers to the device instance path you noted in step 2.1. 
  - Change the value of the MSISupported key from “1” to “0”.
  - If you don’t know which controller your boot device is attached to, 
    repeat steps 2.1 through 2.4 for all AHCI controllers found under 1.2.

- Reboot the machine.

Solution 4
==========
- Reset Virtual memory in windows 10
  - Virtual memory treats disk as RAM

  ----------------------
  - Go to "System Properties" > "Advanced system setting"
  - Click "Settings" in Performance section
  - Select "Advance" tab and click the "Change" button
  - Make sure the text titled "Automatically manage paging file size" is checked
  - You can also choose "No paging file", Press OK and then reboot.
  - This will inhibit the use of virtual memory and may improve disk performance
