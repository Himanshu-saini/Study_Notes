====================
Selection Statement
====================
- Decision making Statement
- Execute from a group of Statements depending on the condition

IF Conditions
=================
- Varations:
  - if {...}
  - if {...} else {...}
  - if {...} else if {...} else {...}

- Syntax:
  if (condition/statement){
    //code lines
  }
  else if (condition/statement){
    //code lines
  }
  else {
    //code lines
  }
- else if block can be increased in case more conditions

Swich statements
=================
- Block of condition is executed depending upon the case 
- Case if executed on the basis of equallity comparision
 
- Syntax:
switch(a){
  case 1:
  // code lines 
  break;
  case 2:
  // code lines 
  break;
  case 3:
  // code lines 
  break;
  case 4:
  // code lines 
  break;
  default:
  // code lines 
}

- case <<value>>:
  <<value>> must be a constant
  either int, char, enum or constant expression (like 2*4)
  
- Switch Fall Out:
  - if "break" statement is not used at the end of case block 
    then the next case block will also be executed untill 
	"break" statement comes or switch block end

- "default" statement is executed when no case is matched
- "default" statement can come also between the cases.
- If "default" statement is not written at the end 
  then "break" statement is must also be added at the end.

- Switch is faster than if else  
  - Switch creates a look up table ( make key:value pair)
  - Time taken to execute any case block is contant 
  - whereas in case of if else, all previous conditions are checked
