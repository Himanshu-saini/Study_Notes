===============
Objects in C++
===============

- Objects like variables of the corresponding class data type
- Memory is allocated on object creation

- Creating Onjects
  ----------------
  - same as declaring a variable
  - <classs name> <object name>;
  - Ex.
    Person pr1;

- Each object will be allocated seperate memory space
  Therefore, changes i values of one object 
  will not affect the values of other object.

- Access object members:
  ----------------------
  - members of class can be accessed by 
    using '.' operator.
  - Ex.
    pr1.name = "Himanshu";  // accessing data member
	cout< pr1.age;
	pr1.print_details();    // accessing member function

  - Only public members can be acessed outside 
    class.
