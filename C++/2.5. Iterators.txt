====================
Iteration Statements
=====================
- Do do a task repeated number of times depending upon the condition

While loop
=============
- Condition is checked before the block is executed

- Syntax:
  while(condition){
    // statements
	// changing loop control variable
  }
  
Do-While loop
=============
- Condition is checked after the block is executed
- The loop block is executed at least one time even if the condition is false

- Syntax:
  do{
    // statements
	// changing loop control variable
  }while(condition);
  
For loop 
==========

- Syntax:
  for(initialization;condition;update control variable){
    // statements 
  }
- Execution:
  - First the variable initilization block is executed 
  - condition is checked 
  - loop block gets executed 
  - update statement gets executed

- Variations:
  - varaible can be declared during initialization 
  - initialize statement can be skipped is the variable is initialized earlier
  - more than one one varianble can be initialized in initialization block seperated by comma 
  - update statement can be skipped, 
    condition variable must be updated inside the block otherwise the loop will execute infinitely
  - More than one variable can be updated in update block seperated by comma 
  - Condition statement can be skipped,
    loop is stopped inside the loop block using "break".
