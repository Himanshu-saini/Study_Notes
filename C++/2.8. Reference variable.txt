====================
Reference Variables
====================
- reference variable is used to provide another name or alias to the existing variable.
- any change in the reference variable is refelected in the main variable.
- Syntax:
  - <data type> &<ref var name> = <existing variable>;

- Ex.
  int a = 20;
  int &b = a;
  cout<<a<<b;  // a=20,b=20
  b = 40;
  cout<<a<<b;  // a=40,b=40

- Points to remember
  ------------------
  - data type of the reference variable must be same as data type of the existing variable 
  - reference variable must be initialized at same place it is declared.
  - once the reference varible is created, it cannot point to other variable.

- Explanation
  ------------
  - Every variable is assigned a memory location by the compiler during its declaration.
  - Variable points to that memory location and save its value.
  - referenve variable points to the memory location of the variable to which it is refered
  - Therefore, both reference variable and refered variable make changes in the same location.
