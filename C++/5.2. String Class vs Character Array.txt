string Class vs Character Array
===============================

Character Array
------------------
- character array is simply an array of characters can terminated by a null character
- character array has to allocated statically
- more memory cannot be allocated at run time if required
- Unused allocated memory is wasted 
- threat of array decay in case of character array. 
- Implementation of character array is faster
- do not offer much inbuilt functions to manipulate strings

string
--------
- A string is a class which defines objects that be represented as stream of characters.
- memory is allocated dynamically
- More memory can be allocated at run time 
- As strings are represented as objects, no array decay occurs.
- Strings are slower than c-strings (character array)
  - behind the implementation, the string is converted into 
    character array.
- defines a number of functionalities which allow manifold operations on strings.
