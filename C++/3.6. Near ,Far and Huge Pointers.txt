Near ,Far and Huge Pointers
============================
- NEAR=2, FAR=4 AND HUGE=4 POINTERS EXIST ONLY UNDER DOS. 
- UNDER WINDOWS AND LINUX EVERY POINTERS IS 4 BYTES LONG OR 8 BYTES LONG DEPENDING UPON THE OS.

- NEAR POINTER IS USED TO STORE 16 BIT ADDRESSES MEANS WITHIN CURRENT SEGMENT ON A 16 BIT MACHINE. 
  THE LIMITATION IS THAT WE CAN ONLY ACCESS 64KB OF DATA AT A TIME.

- A FAR POINTER IS TYPICALLY 32 BIT THAT CAN ACCESS MEMORY OUTSIDE CURRENT SEGMENT. 
  TO USE THIS, COMPILER ALLOCATES A SEGMENT REGISTER TO STORE SEGMENT ADDRESS, 
  THEN ANOTHER REGISTER TO STORE OFFSET WITHIN CURRENT SEGMENT.

- LIKE FAR POINTER, HUGE POINTER IS ALSO TYPICALLY 32 BIT AND CAN ACCESS OUTSIDE SEGMENT. 
  IN CASE OF FAR POINTERS, A SEGMENT IS FIXED. 
  IN FAR POINTER, THE SEGMENT PART CANNOT BE MODIFIED, BUT IN HUGE IT CAN BE CHANGED.
