============================
PowerShell VS Command Prompt
=============================

- Windows 7 added PowerShell, a more powerful command-line shell 
  and scripting language than the Command Prompt.
- PowerShell is more complicated than the traditional Command Prompt, 
  but it’s also much more powerful.
- The Command Prompt is dramatically inferior to shells available 
  for Linux and other Unix-like systems, but PowerShell competes favorably.

Command Prompt 
=================
- The Command Prompt is essentially just a legacy environment carried forward in Windows
  — an environment that copies all of the various DOS commands you would find on a DOS system.

PowerShell
===========
- PowerShell is a new environment for Windows system administrators that 
  allows them to use a more modern command-line environment to manage Windows.
- It uses different commands, known as cmdlets in PowerShell. 
- you can use multiple cmdlets in sequence to manipulate the same data.
- Unlike Unix-like systems—which can only pipe streams of characters (text) —
  PowerShell pipes objects between cmdlets.
- pretty much everything in PowerShell is an object, including every response you get from a cmdlet.
  - This allows PowerShell to share more complex data between cmdlets, 
    operating more like a programming language.
- It’s a powerful scripting environment you can use to create complex scripts 
  for managing Windows systems much more easily than you could with the Command Prompt.

Commands
----------
- PowerShell contains “aliases” that point to the old commands at the appropriate new cmdlets, 
  running the new cmdlets when you type the old commands.
- To see if a DOS command has an alias, you can use the Get-Alias cmdlet.
  - Ex.
    > Get-Alias cd 

- Change a Directory
  - DOS:  cd
  - PowerShell:  Set-Location
- List Files in a Directory
  - DOS:  dir
  - PowerShell:  Get-ChildItem
- Rename a File
  - DOS:  rename
  - PowerShell:  Rename-Item
