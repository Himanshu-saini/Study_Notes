Docker engine:
====================
- Docker engine compose of 3 components:
- Docker CLI <-> REST API <-> Docker Daemon

- Docker daemon is the background process that manages the docker objects such as images,volumes,networks,..
- REST API is the api interface that program uses to provide instruction to the Daemon
- Docker CLI is the command line interface that we uses to perform actions.
- Docker CLI can be at the different host from the API and can interact with remote API like:
  $ docker â€“H=remote-docker-engine:2375		// provide address to the remote engine
