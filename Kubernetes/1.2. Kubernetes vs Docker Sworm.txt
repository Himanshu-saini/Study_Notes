==========================
Kubernetes vs docker swarm
==========================
- Both are Orchestration system to handle the containers.

- Auto Scaling 
  kubernetes can analyse server load based on that it can scale up or scale down
- Load balancing – 
  - Kubernetes: Sometimes we have the manually configure load balancing 
    because in kubernetes multiple containers can server as a single pod 
    and each service can be defined as a group of pods.
  - Docker swarm does auto load balancing.
- Rolling updates – 
  - It is the process of progressively and gradually deploying updates to the existing application in all containers.
  - Both can use rolling update.
  - In case of failure kubernetes does auto roll back to previous update 
  - docker swarm does not automatically roll back.
- Shared volumes – 
  - Docker swarm allows sharing volumes with any other containers.
    Swarm uses 3rd party app for logging and monitoring. 
  - kubernetes allows sharing volumes with containers in same pod 
    kebernetes allow to mount the storage locally or on cloud like AWS. 
    It also provide inbuild logging and monitoring.
    - Logging helps in finding the problem in case of failure.
    - Monitoring helps master node to analyse the health of the nodes and services containerized.
