========================
Kubernetes architecture
========================
- Kubectl: 
  cli though which we can all cluster services and work nodes.
- Master node: 
  API server 
  -> control manager 
  -> Scheduler
  -> etcd
- Worker nodes: 
  Kubelet and kube-proxy 
  -> many pods 
    -> containers

- Pods is a basic unit of kubernetes architecture. 
- Pod can have many container images.

Master node: 
============
- handles all administrative tasks that are responsible for managing kubernetes cluster.
- We can have more than one master nodes.
- One of them will be main node and other worker.
- For managing cluster state it uses etcd to which all master nodes are connected.

API server:
------------ 
- handles all the REST commands used to control the cluster.
- After executing the request, resulting state of cluster is stored in distributed key-value store.

Etcd: 
------
- distributed key-value store that stores the cluster state. 
- Can be part of master or can be configured externally. 
- Also used to store the configuration details such as subnets, config maps, secrets,..

Scheduler: 
----------
- it schedule the task to the slave nodes. 
- It stores the resources usage information for each node 
  and then schedules the work in form of pods and services. 
- It also takes into account the quality of service requirement, data locality, affinity and anti-affinity.

Controller managers or managers: 
-------------------------------
- daemon which regulates the cluster. 
- Also performs lifestyle functions like namespace creation and lifecycle,  
  event garbage collection, terminated pod garbage collection, 
  cascading deleted garbage collection, node garbage collection, etc.
- It ensures that the current state of node in same as the desired state.

Worker nodes:
===============
Kubelet 
----------
- is the agent that communicates with the master node and executes on the worker nodes.
- Ensures the pods are running and healthy.

Kube-proxy: 
------------
- runs on each nodes.
- Deals with individual host subneting. 
- Ensures that the services are available to the external parties. 
- Network proxy and load balancer for single worker node and manages the network routing
