3: create project directory:	$mkdir projectdir
4: initialize blockchain project using: $truffle init	// create project structure
5: create dependencies file (package.json)
6: Update truffle-config for network settings
7: Make a new contract in projectdir/contracts/  as newContract.sol

  $accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()	//get all account in network
  $ blockNumber = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber()	//get current active block number
