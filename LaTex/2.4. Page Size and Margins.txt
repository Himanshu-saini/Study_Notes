=====================
Page Size and Margins
=====================
- Paper size, orientation and margins are the most common page elements
- default value for orientation is portrait
- To set the desired values there are two ways
  - pass them as parameters to the \includepackage or \usepackage 
  - use a \geometry command in the preamble

- Ex.
  \usepackage[legalpaper, landscape, margin=2in]{geometry}
  OR
  \usepackage{geometry}
  \geometry{legalpaper, landscape, margin=2in}
  - paper size is set to legalpaper 
  - page orientation is changed to landscape 
  - each margin is set to 2 in.
  
- Ex.
  \usepackage[left=2cm, right=5cm, top=2cmm,bottom=1cm]{geometry}
  - Set all the margins for the text area
