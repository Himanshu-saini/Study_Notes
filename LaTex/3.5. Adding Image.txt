=======================
Adding images in lATEX
=======================

- you will need to use a package -  graphicx
  - \usepackage{graphicx}
  
- Add path from which image is included 
  - \graphicspath{ {images/} }
  - path is relative to the current directory
  - added in Document Preamble
  
- Includeing image in document 
  - \includegraphics{imageName}
  - imageName is name of the file containing the image without the extension
  - file name of the image should not contain white spaces nor multiple dots  
  - file extension is allowed to be included, but it's a good idea to omit it
  
- caption for the figure
  - \caption{a nice plot}
  - can place it above or below the figure
  
- Adddign lable
  - \label{fig:mesh1}
  - refer the image within your document
  -  label will number the image  
  - add reference with this name 
  
- Add reference
  - \ref{fig:mesh1}
  - code will be substituted by the number corresponding to the referenced figure

- If you are using captions and references on your own computer
  you will have to compile the document twice for the references to work

- Ex. 
  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{mesh}
    \caption{a nice plot}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
  \end{figure}

- we should always put them inside a figure environment or similar 
  so that LATEX will position the image in a way that fits in with the rest of your text
