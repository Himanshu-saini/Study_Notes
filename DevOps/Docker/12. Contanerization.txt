Containerization:
====================
- Docker uses namespace to provide isolation between containers.
- Process ID , Network, Interprocess, Mount, Unix timesharing are created in their own namespace.
- By default there is no restriction on how much resources of the host a container can use 
  and so a container can use all of the resources of the host.
- Docker uses cgroups (control groups) to restrict the amount of hardware resources 
  (CPU and Memory) allocated to each container.
  $docker run –cpus=.5 ubuntu		//limits the max cpu usage to 50% by the container
  $docker run –memory=100m ubuntu 		//limits the use of memory to 100mb
