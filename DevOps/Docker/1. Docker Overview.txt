About Docker
===========================
- Docker is a container management system. 
- The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. 

Features of containers
-------------------------
•	Flexible:
•	Lightweight
•	Portable
•	Loosely coupled
•	Scalable
•	Secure

- Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers. 
- Docker uses same OS kernel and build isolated container on it.
- The docker container will run on system with same OS kernel i.e., linux containers run on linux machines and windows containers on windows.
- It provides high level environment and powerful tools for using container by the user.

Docker image: 
---------------
- An image includes everything needed to run an application - the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
Docker container: 
------------------
- running instances of images that have separate environment.

Architecture
===============
- Hardware 
  -> OS 
    -> Docker 	
		–container (library and dependencies -> application)
		-container (library and dependencies -> application)
		-container  (library and dependencies -> application)
		

Install Docker applications: 
-----------------------------
- Many docker images of common software are stored in Docker Hub (hub.docker.com) or Docker storage. 
- $ docker run <image name> // image: nodejs,mongodb..

Active Time of Container:
==========================
Containers are meant to run a specific task/precess. 
Container only lives as long as the program inside it is alive then it exits. 
Ex. If a webserver inside a container stops or crashes it stops.
$ docker run Ubuntu sleep 5  // run sleep command in the Ubuntu image, wait for the rogram to sleep then exits
