Layered Architecture:
======================
- When the docker build an image in a layered architecture. 
  Each instruction creates a layer with only changes from the previous layer.
- All the docker layers are cached so if the docker build is failed it will use the cached layers when we rerun the build command.

- To see the each layer and space used by it use:
  $ docker history <image name> 

**Docker uses storage driver to implement layered architecture. 

- Storage driver depends on the OS we use. 
  Like Ubuntu uses AUFS storage driver.
