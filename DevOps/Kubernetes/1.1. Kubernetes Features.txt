Kubernetes Features
===================
- Automatically places the containers on the bases of their resource requirements 
  while not sacrificing the availability.
- It gives containers their own IP addresses and DNS theme which can load balance across them.
- It automatically mounts the storage system 
  whether it is local storage or public cloud like AWS or a network storage system like NFS.
- It also restarts at fails, replaces and reschedule the containers, 
  kills the containers which do not response to user defined health checks 
  and does not advertise them to the client until they are ready to server
- Deploys and updates secretes and application configuration 
  without rebuilding images and without exposing the secretes
- Can also manages batch and CI workloads by replacing containers that fails.
- Progressively rolls out changes to the application and its configurations 
  while monitoring the application health to ensure it does not kill all at the same time.
