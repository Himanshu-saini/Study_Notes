  For system-wide configuration use --system
  
- check your configuration with:
  - git config --list

- Git maintains 3 sections on a local system
  - Workspace/Wroking Dir
    - where the code is created
    - untracked files
  - Stagging Area
    - intermediated buffer zone of git
    - Here files are called indexed files
  - Local Repository
    - location where version controlling happens
    - Files present here are called commited files

- check the status of each file in your directory 
  - $ git status
