==============================
Use of diferent remote URLs 
==============================
- There are several ways to clone repositories available on GitHub.
- These URLs are used for git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push

HTTPs URLs
============
- https://github.com/<username>/<repo name>
- Using HTTPs urls for accessing private repository, 
  Git will ask for your GitHub username and password.
- But for accessing public repository git will not ask for credentials..

- If you have enabled two-factor authentication, 
  or if you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), 
  you must authenticate with a personal access token instead of your username and password for GitHub.
  
SSH URLs
===============
- To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and 
  add the public key to your GitHub account.

Check any existing SSH keys [Linux]
----------------------------------------
- $ ls -al ~/.ssh
- By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:
  - id_rsa.pub
  - id_ecdsa.pub
  - id_ed25519.pub

Generating a new SSH key
---------------------------
- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
- Leave file path empty to save to default location when prompted.
- Addign Paraphrase is optional

- It will create 2 files: 
  id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key)
  to location ~/.ssh

Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
-------------------------------------
- Start the ssh-agent in the background.
  - $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  (output)> Agent pid 59566

- Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. 
  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  Replace id_rsa incase of different name
  
Add a new SSH key to your GitHub account
-------------------------------------------
- Copy the public key content (id_rsa.pub)
- Go to Guthub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys
- Click add SSH key
  Enter Title(tag name) and paste the public key
- Click "Add key" and enter password.

Testing your SSH connection
----------------------------
- $ ssh -T git@github.com
