===========
Scope Chain
===========

- When a variable is used in JavaScript, 
  the JavaScript engine will try to find the variableâ€™s value 
  in the current scope. If it could not find the variable, 
  it will look into the outer scope and will continue to do so 
  until it finds the variable or reaches global scope.
- Ex.
  var name = "Global";
  
  function fun1(){
    var name = "fun1";
    console.log(`In fun1 scope name is ${name}`)  // prints fun1
    function fun2(){
      console.log(`In fun2 scope name is ${name}`)  // prints fun1
    }
    fun2(); 
  }
  fun1();
  console.log(`In global scope name is ${name}`)  // prints Global
