========================
Variables and DataTypes
========================
- Reserve space in memory
- JavaScript is Dynamically Types Language
  - it does not require to define the data type of variable

- Declaration:
  ------------
  - var 
    - declare variable with program scope 
	- Memory is reserved by varible during whole program.
	- var variables are initialized with "undefined"
	- we can access variable with var from window object 
	  if it is defined globally.
	- variable with var can be redeclared to some other value
      var a = 'hello';
      var a = 'world'; // No problem, 'hello' is replaced.
    - var firstName = "Himanshu";  // declaration and initialization
	- var firstName;			// Declaration
	  firstName = "Himanshu"; 	// Initialization
  
  - let 
    - declare varible with block scope
	- memory reserved is released when the compiler comes out of the block
	- variable with let also do not get added with global window object 
	  even if it get declared outside of any block
	- variable could not be redeclared if it is defined with let.
      let b = 'hello';
      let b = 'world'; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared

  - const 
    - declare constant variable
	- block scoped.
	- const must be initialized during declaration.
	- const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
	- const uid = "1234";

Data Types in JavaScript 
=========================
- numbers : integers or float
- strings 
- Boolean : true (1) / false (0)
- objects 
- undefined : no value is stored in the variable
