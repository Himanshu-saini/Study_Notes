Precedence and Associativity
=============================

Operator Precedence
======================
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

- determines how operators are parsed concerning each other

Asssociativity
==============
- Left-associativity (left-to-right) means that it is processed as (a OP1 b) OP2 c,
  while right-associativity (right-to-left) means it is interpreted as a OP1 (b OP2 c).
- Assignment operators are right-associative
  - a = b = 5; // same as writing a = (b = 5);
  - assignment operator returns the value that is assigned

- Remember that precedence comes before associativity.
