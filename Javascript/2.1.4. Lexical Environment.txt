=====================
Lexical Environment
=====================

- structure that holds identifier-variable mapping
  - place where variables and references to the objects are stored.
- A new lexical environment is created for each lexical scope 
  but only when the code in that scope is executed.
- Ex. 
  lexicalEnvironment = {
    a: 25,
    obj: <ref. to the object>
    outer: <outer lexical environemt>  // null in case of global 
  }

- So when a variable is used in a program, 
  the JavaScript engine will try to find the variable in 
  the current lexical environment and if it could not find 
  the variable there, it looks inside the outer 
  lexical environment to find the variable. 
  So thatâ€™s how the JavaScript engine performs variable lookups.
  
lexical scope
-------------
- a scope that is determined at compile time
