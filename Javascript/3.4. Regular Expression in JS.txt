Creating a regular expression
==============================
- Using a regular expression literal
  -----------------------------------
  - pattern enclosed between slashes
  - compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded
  - let re = /ab+c/;
  - use when regular expression remains constant
  
- calling the constructor function of the RegExp object,
  ------------------------------------------------------
  - let re = new RegExp('ab+c');
  - provides runtime compilation of the regular expression
  - Use the constructor function when you know 
    the regular expression pattern will be changing
	like user input
