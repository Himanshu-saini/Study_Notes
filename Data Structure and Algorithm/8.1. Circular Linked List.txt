=====================
Circular Linked List
=====================

- Next pointer of last node in both SLL or DLL points to 
  first node of the list
- The previous pointer of 1st node in DLL points to last node.
- Generally implemented using SLL.

- Here, Insertion/Deletion from beginning/end will be like 
  insertion/deletion in the middle of list in SLL/DLL.

Use Case
----------
- Round Robin Scheduling

Count Number of Nodes
=========================

int countNodes(node** HEAD){
  node* currPtr = *HEAD;
  int count=0;
  do{
    count++;
    currPtr = currPtr->next;
  }while(currPtr!=*HEAD);
  return count;
}
