====================
Direct Access Table
====================

- A table used to store the key:value pair
- Represented by an array
- array index becomes the key and corresponding values are stored
- Required O(1) time to perform insertion/deletion/searching

- Useful to store value having continuous keys
  - like frequency of each digit in a number

- Dissadvantage:
  - require large space in case of storing large keys
  - Ex. 100001:ABC, 100004: EFG, 100006: HIJ
    - It required array size of 2^5 + 1
