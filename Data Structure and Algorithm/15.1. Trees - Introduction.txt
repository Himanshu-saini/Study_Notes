Trees
======
- Non linear data structure
- A node can points to n nodes

Terminology
-----------
- Root Node
  - 1st node / Topmost node of tree
  - Have no parent
- Leaf node 
  - nodes having no child
- Parent Node 
  - node from which 1 or more nodes emerges
- Child node 
  - immediate next node of another node
- Sibling nodes 
  - child nodes of same parent node
- Ansester nodes
  - All nodes that comes in path from root to given node 
  - parent, parent of parent, ...., root
- Edge
  - link between parent and child node
- Sub-tree
  - tree present at one edge of a node

- Height
  ------
  - Distance from the bottom
  - Height of Node
    - distance of node from the deepest node (deepest leaf)
  - Height of Tree
    - height of root node 
	- maximum height among all node 
- Level
  -----
  - Distance from the top
  - Level of Node
    - distance between node and root
	- level of root node = 0
  - Level/Depth of Tree
	- level of deepest node
    - Maximum level among all nodes
