Bit Manupulation
=================
- In computer numbers are represented as binary numbers 
  that are atored in Bits format.

- Initially, negative number is thought to be represented by 
  using MSB(Most Significant Bit), the rightmost Bit of the number
  with 0 at MSB for positive and 1 for negative
  Problems :
  - 0 have 2 representation 1000 and 0000 (4-bit machine)
  - Addition sometime gives wrong answer
  
- New Concept was adopted to use 2's compliment of positive 
  number as its negative representation.
  - Ex. 4 -> 0100
    0100 -> 1's compliment -> 1011 + 1 -> 1100 (2's compliment)
    Therefore, -4 -> 1100
  - Any number with MSB as 1 represents a negative number
    - Its 2's complement is calculated to get 
	  the magnitude of the negative number

- 1's compliment 
  ---------------
  - reverse the Bit of the number 
  - 1 is converted to 0 and 0 to 1
  - Ex. 1's compliment of 0100 = 1011
  
- 2's comliment 
  --------------
  - take 1's compliment of number
  - Add 1 in the result
  - 2's compliment of a number change its sign 
    - positive number become negative
	- negative number becomes positive
  - (-x) = ~x + 1
