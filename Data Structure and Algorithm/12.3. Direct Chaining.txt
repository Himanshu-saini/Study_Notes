- Singly Linked list is used to store values 
- No data is lost

- Hash Map is created to store the HEAD of a linked list 
- When a value is mapped to a slot, that value is added 
  to the corresponding linked list (at beginning of linked list)

- Advantages
  - Deletion is simple
- Disadvantages 
  - Uses extra memory outside Hash Table 

- Complexity:
  ------------
  - Insertion : O(1)
  - Searching 
    - Worst case : O(n)
	  - when all values are mapped to a single slot 
	  - A good hash function is used to prevent it 
	- Average case: O(1)
  - Deletion
    - Worst case: O(n)
	  - when all values are stored to same slot 
	- Average case : O(1)

- N : Number of elements
- S : size of hash table
- Load Factor(alpha), α  : N/S 

- Proof : Searching Complexity 
  - if all values are evenly distributed in Hash Map
    then, each linked contain N/S elements
  - Seaching in Hash Map : O(1+N/S)
    - 1 for searching hash slot 
	- N/S for searching in Linked List

  - Choosing N as multiple of S 
    - N = k*S 
      - k = constant
  - α = N/S = k*S/S = k = constant 
  - Seaching = O(1+k) = O(1)
