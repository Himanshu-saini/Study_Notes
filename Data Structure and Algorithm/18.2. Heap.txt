Heap
=======

- Tree with special properties
  - All child elements are smaller/greater than the parent element
  - It should be a balanced tree 
    - all leaf nodes should be at height H or H-2

- Heap structure change depending upon inserting elements approach
  - Bottom up Approach
    - Convert array, representing complete Binary Tree into heap
	  using "build-heap" approach
  - Top-down Approach
    - insert element one-by-one and take care of heap property

- We can get different heap from these 2 approaches

Operations
----------
- Insertion
  - Bottom up 
    - complexity: O(n) for all element
  - Top-down 
    - Complexity: O(log n) for each element
- Deletion
  - Extract-min / Extract-max
  - complexity : O(log n)
- Updation
  - Decrease key / insrease key 
  - complexity : O(log n)
