==================
Sorting Algorithms
==================
- Arranging elements in a particular order (Increasing / Decreasing)

Classifications
================

- Comparison Based
  -----------------
  - Bubble sort
  - Merge sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort 
  - We do certain comparison to decide how to sort the array

- Swapping 
  ---------
  - Judge an algorithm based on how many times swapping is happening
  - called "Inversion Count"

- Space / Inplace / In-Memory sorting
  -------------------------
  - Require extra space for sorting 
  - Internal
    - Takes place in main memory
  - External 
    - Takes place in external memory 

- Time complexity
  ---------------

- Recursive or Iterative Sorting 
  ------------------------------
  - Recursive sort 
    - Merge sort 
	- Quick Sort 
  - Iterative sort 
    - Insertion sort 
	- Bubble sort 
	- Selection sort 

- Stability
  ---------
  - In case of duplicate numbers in array,
    if order of number if preserved i.e., element coming first in
	unsorted array is coming first in sorted array 
	then the algorithm is stable
